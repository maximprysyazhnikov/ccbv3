### XRPUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: NO_TRADE  
**Confidence**: N/A  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed with lower highs/lows; recent bounce lacks volume conviction.  
- **Orderbook**: Despite BUY_DOMINANT imbalance, walls at 2.9921 (bid) and 2.997 (ask) limit near-term momentum.  
- **News**: Mixed sentiment (leverage stress vs. XRP utility adoption) lacks clear directional catalyst.  
- **Price Action**: Failed to hold key support at 3.00; no reversal pattern yet.  
- **Risk/Reward**: Unfavorable until clear breakout above 2.997 or breakdown below 2.9921.
