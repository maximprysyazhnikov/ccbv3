# ETHUSDT Trade Brief

- **Direction**: NO_TRADE  
- **Confidence**: 60%  
- **Reasoning**:  
  - **Technical**: ETHUSDT shows weak momentum with consistent lower highs and lows, indicating bearish pressure.  
  - **Orderbook**: Despite BUY_DOMINANT imbalance, bid/ask walls are thin, suggesting low conviction.  
  - **News**: Rising leverage trades and regulatory uncertainty add market stress, increasing volatility risk.  
  - **Volume**: Recent spikes in volume during downtrends signal potential capitulation, not reversal.  
  - **Conclusion**: Lack of clear bullish catalysts and weak technicals favor staying sidelined.
