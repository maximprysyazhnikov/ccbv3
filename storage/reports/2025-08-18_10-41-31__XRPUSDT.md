### XRPUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 70%  
**Entry**: 2.9747 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 3.0050 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 2.9200 (support zone)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed by lower highs/lows; recent rejection at 3.0 resistance.  
- **Orderbook**: Sell dominance (imbalance) + ask wall at 2.9754 adds overhead pressure.  
- **Volume**: High sell-volume during drops vs. weak rallies.  
- **News**: XRP-specific profit-taking noted; broader crypto leverage stress signals caution.  
- **Sentiment**: Bitcoin ETF inflows not translating to altcoin strength.
