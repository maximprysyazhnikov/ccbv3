### SOLUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 182.79 (top bid)  
**Stop**: 183.5 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 180.5 (support zone)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed on 5m, lower highs/lows, rejection at 183.2 resistance.  
- **Orderbook**: Buy dominance but thin bid wall (182.31) vs stronger ask wall (183.2).  
- **Volume**: High sell volume spikes near lows (e.g., 73k at 186.53).  
- **News**: Leverage stress warnings (Galaxy Digital) may trigger liquidations.  
- **Sentiment**: Mixed institutional flows (Goldman ETF news offset by Fed regulatory pullback).  

*Note: Tight stop due to volatile macro news flow.*
