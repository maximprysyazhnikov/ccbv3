**Direction:** NO_TRADE  
**Confidence:** 70%  
**Reasoning:**  
- **Technical:** Price is consolidating near support at 183.03 with no clear breakout or breakdown.  
- **Orderbook:** BUY_DOMINANT imbalance, but bid wall at 182.75 is weak compared to ask wall at 183.37.  
- **News:** Mixed sentiment with rising leverage stress warnings but institutional buying spree in Bitcoin ETFs.  
- **Volume:** Low volume in recent candles suggests lack of conviction.  
- **Risk:** High uncertainty in broader crypto market due to regulatory and leverage concerns.
