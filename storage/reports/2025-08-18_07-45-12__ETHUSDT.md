### ETHUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 4326.3 (top bid)  
**Stop**: 4343.8 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 4290.0 (support zone)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend on 5m, lower highs/lows, rejection at 4343 resistance.  
- **Orderbook**: Sell dominance (216.7 vs 40.0 bid vol), weak bid wall at 4325.58.  
- **News**: Rising leverage stress (Galaxy Digital), Fed scraps crypto oversight group.  
- **Volume**: Bearish spikes on down moves, weak recovery attempts.  
- **Risk**: BTC ETF inflows (Goldman/Harvard) could counter sentiment.
