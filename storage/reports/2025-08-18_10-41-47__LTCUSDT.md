### LTCUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 116.24 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 117.50 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 114.50 (support level)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed with lower highs/lows, recent breakdown below $118 support.  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but weak bid support near current price; ask wall at 116.61 may cap upside.  
- **Volume**: Elevated sell volume during breakdowns, weak buying interest on rebounds.  
- **News**: Crypto leverage stress signals (Galaxy Digital) and altcoin rotation risks (Coindesk).  
- **Sentiment**: Bitcoin pullback risks could spill over to alts like LTC.
