### ETHUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: LONG  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 4340 (above current ask wall)  
**Stop**: 4280 (below recent swing low)  
**Take**: 4450 (next resistance zone)  

**Reasoning**:  
- *Technical*: Strong uptrend with higher highs/lows, recent pullback to support (~4320)  
- *Orderbook*: Buy-side dominance (imbalance) with thin ask liquidity above  
- *News*: Institutional buying spree (Goldman/Harvard ETF inflows) offsets leverage concerns  
- *Volume*: Sustained buying volume on up-moves, weak sell pressure  
- *Risk*: Leverage stress warning could trigger short-term volatility
