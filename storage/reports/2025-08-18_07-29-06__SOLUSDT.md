- **News:** Rising leverage trades show signs of stress, potentially increasing market volatility.  
- **Volume:** Recent candles show declining volume, suggesting lack of strong buying interest.  
- **Risk:** High uncertainty in the broader crypto market due to regulatory and macroeconomic factors.
