### ADAUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 0.9150 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 0.9250 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 0.8900 (support zone)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Rejection at 0.9266 resistance, lower highs forming on 1h chart.  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but ask wall at 0.9185 caps upside; bid support weakens below 0.9101.  
- **Volume**: Declining volume on up-moves suggests lack of conviction.  
- **News**: Rising leverage stress (Galaxy Digital) may trigger liquidations.  
- **Sentiment**: Altcoin gains driven by speculation (Binance report), prone to pullbacks.
