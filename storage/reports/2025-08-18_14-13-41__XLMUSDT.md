### XLMUSDT Trade Brief (15m)

**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 0.407  
**Stop**: 0.4105  
**Take**: 0.402  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Failed breakout above 0.432 resistance; lower highs forming.  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but bid wall at 0.403 suggests weak support.  
- **Volume**: Declining volume on upticks, bearish divergence.  
- **News**: Crypto leverage stress signals (Galaxy Digital) may dampen altcoin sentiment.  
- **Sentiment**: ETH weakness (news) likely spills over to alts like XLM.  

*Note: Tight stop due to recent volatility; monitor BTC correlation.*
