# XRPUSDT Trade Brief (5m)

**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 2.9884 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 3.0100 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 2.9500 (psychological support)  

### Reasoning:
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed with lower highs/lows; rejection at 3.01 resistance.
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but thin liquidity near current price; bid wall at 2.985 may slow descent.
- **Volume**: High sell-volume spikes during down moves (1.2M+ candles).
- **News**: Mixed sentiment - XRP utility news offset by broader leverage concerns.
- **Risk**: Watch for BTC correlation if ETF buying resumes.

*Note: Tight stop due to volatile crypto conditions.*
