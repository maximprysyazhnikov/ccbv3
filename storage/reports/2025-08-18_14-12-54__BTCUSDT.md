### BTCUSDT Trade Brief (15m)  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 115,120.0 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 115,500.0 (~3.3% above entry)  
**Take**: 114,000.0 (~1% below entry)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Failed breakout after recent pump; lower highs forming near resistance (~115.5K).  
- **Orderbook**: Sell-dominant imbalance (11.57 vs 4.48 BTC volume topN), strong ask wall at entry.  
- **News**: Mixed sentiment (ETF inflows vs. leverage stress warnings).  
- **Volume**: Weak follow-through on upside attempts.  
- **Risk**: Stop tight due to high volatility zone.
