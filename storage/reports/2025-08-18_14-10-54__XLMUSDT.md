### XLMUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 65%  
**Entry**: 0.4064 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 0.4079 (above ask wall)  
**Take**: 0.4030 (bid wall)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed (lower highs/lows, recent breakdown below 0.425 support).  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but bid wall at 0.4030 offers profit target; ask wall at 0.4079 limits upside.  
- **Volume**: High sell-side volume near breakdown levels (2.4M at 0.4263).  
- **News**: Neutral crypto sentiment (leveraged stress, ETF inflows offset by Do Kwon guilty plea).  
- **Risk**: Thin liquidity below 0.4030; monitor for bid wall absorption.
