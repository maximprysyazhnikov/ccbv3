**Direction:** NO_TRADE  
**Confidence:** 70%  
**Reasoning:**  
- **Technical Analysis:** XRPUSDT shows a volatile downtrend with no clear reversal pattern. Recent price action is choppy, indicating indecision.  
- **Orderbook:** Despite a BUY_DOMINANT imbalance, the bid and ask walls are weak, suggesting limited support/resistance.  
- **News:** Positive adoption news (XRP Ledger used by Nasdaq-listed pharma distributor) is offset by broader market stress signals (rising leverage trades).  
- **Risk:** High volatility and lack of clear directional bias make trading risky.  
- **Conclusion:** Wait for clearer price action or stronger market signals before entering a trade.
