### SOLUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: LONG  
**Confidence**: 65%  
**Entry**: 182.41 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 181.80 (below recent swing low)  
**Take**: 183.50 (near ask wall resistance)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Price stabilizing near 182 support after sharp drop; potential reversal candle forming.  
- **Orderbook**: BUY_DOMINANT imbalance with strong bid wall (25k SOL) vs. thin ask wall (12k SOL).  
- **News**: Institutional buying spree (Goldman, Harvard) may spill over to altcoins like SOL.  
- **Risk**: Leverage stress warnings (Galaxy Digital) could amplify downside if support breaks.  
- **Volume**: Recent high-volume drop suggests caution; tight stop advised.
