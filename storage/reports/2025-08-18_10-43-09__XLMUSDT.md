### XLMUSDT Trade Brief (1h)  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 0.4093 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 0.4125 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 0.4050 (near bid wall)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed with lower highs/lows; rejection at 0.4125 resistance.  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but bid wall at 0.4075 offers downside target; ask wall at 0.4109 caps upside.  
- **Volume**: Elevated sell-side volume during drops (e.g., 7.8M at 0.4418 â†’ 0.4233).  
- **News**: Macro caution from Galaxy Digital on leverage stress; altcoin focus lacks XLM-specific catalysts.  
- **Risk**: Tight stop avoids ETH/BTC volatility spillover risks.
