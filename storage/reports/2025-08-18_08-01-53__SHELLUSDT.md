### SHELLUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: LONG  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 0.1339 (top ask)  
**Stop**: 0.1313 (bid wall support)  
**Take**: 0.1380 (3x risk, near prior resistance)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Recent bounce from 0.1306 low with higher lows forming; RSI divergence suggests weakening downtrend.  
- **Orderbook**: BUY_DOMINANT imbalance (bid vol 2.3x ask vol) with strong bid wall at 0.1313.  
- **News**: Institutional buying spree (Goldman/Harvard ETF inflows) may spill over to altcoins.  
- **Volume**: Spike on last bullish candle (455k vs avg ~300k).  
- **Risk**: Leverage stress warning (Galaxy Digital) could increase volatility.  

*Note: Tight stop due to macro uncertainty.*
