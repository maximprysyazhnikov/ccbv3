### BTCUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 70%  
**Entry**: 115455.0 (top bid)  
**Stop**: 115519.1 (above recent swing high)  
**Take**: 115100.0 (support zone)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Rejection at resistance (~115500) with lower highs on 5m.  
- **Orderbook**: Sell-dominant imbalance + thicker ask wall (13.2 BTC vs 6.8 BTC bids).  
- **News**: Rising leverage stress (Galaxy Digital) may trigger liquidations.  
- **Volume**: Weak bids during rallies; strong sell volume at resistance.  
- **Context**: Institutional ETF buying (bullish) countered by local exhaustion.
