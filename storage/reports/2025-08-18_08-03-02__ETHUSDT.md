# ETHUSDT Trade Brief

- **Direction**: LONG  
- **Confidence**: 75%  
- **Entry**: 4342.25  
- **Stop**: 4300.00  
- **Take**: 4450.00  

### Reasoning:  
- **Technical**: ETH shows bullish momentum with a breakout above 4300 resistance, supported by rising volume.  
- **Orderbook**: BUY_DOMINANT imbalance with a strong bid wall at 4341.45, indicating buyer support.  
- **News**: Institutional interest in crypto ETFs (Goldman Sachs, Harvard) boosts sentiment for ETH.  
- **Market Sentiment**: Rising leverage trades suggest speculative interest, but Galaxy Digital warns of stress signals.  
- **Risk**: Potential pullback if leverage-induced stress materializes; stop-loss mitigates downside risk.
