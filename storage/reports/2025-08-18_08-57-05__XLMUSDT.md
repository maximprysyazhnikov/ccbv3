### XLMUSDT Trade Brief (1h)  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 0.4120  
**Stop**: 0.4155 (+0.85%)  
**Take**: 0.4050 (-1.70%)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Downtrend confirmed (lower highs/lows, recent breakdown below 0.4150 support).  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but bid wall at 0.4094 may slow descent; ask liquidity thin near entry.  
- **Volume**: Bearish volume spikes on down-candles signal selling pressure.  
- **News**: Rising leverage stress (Galaxy Digital) could amplify downside in alts like XLM.  
- **Context**: Broader crypto gains driven by BTC ETFs, but XLM lags (underperformance).
