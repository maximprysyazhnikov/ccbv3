**Direction:** NO_TRADE  
**Confidence:** 60%  
**Reasoning:**  
- **Technical Analysis:** Price action shows consolidation with no clear trend, oscillating between 182.5 and 183.2.  
- **Orderbook:** Despite BUY_DOMINANT imbalance, bid and ask walls are close, indicating potential indecision.  
- **News:** Mixed sentiment with rising leverage stress but institutional buying in Bitcoin ETFs.  
- **Volume:** Recent spikes in volume during price drops suggest selling pressure.  
- **Risk:** Lack of clear directional bias and mixed signals make a trade unattractive at this time.
