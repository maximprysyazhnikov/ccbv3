### ADAUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: LONG  
**Confidence**: 70%  
**Entry**: 0.9265 (above current top ask)  
**Stop**: 0.9150 (below recent swing low)  
**Take**: 0.9500 (near prior resistance)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Strong uptrend with higher highs/lows; recent pullback to support (~0.9215) held.  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced but bid wall at 0.9215 provides downside cushion.  
- **Volume**: Sustained high volume on rallies signals accumulation.  
- **News**: Altcoin momentum highlighted by Binance report; institutional interest spillover (Bitcoin ETF buying).  
- **Risk**: Leverage stress warning (Galaxy Digital) could trigger short-term volatility.
