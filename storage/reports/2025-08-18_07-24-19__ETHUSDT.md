### ETHUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: SHORT  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 4319.5  
**Stop**: 4336.5 (+17pts)  
**Take**: 4280.0 (-39.5pts)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Descending channel with lower highs/lows; rejection at 4325 resistance.  
- **Orderbook**: Buy-side imbalance but thin bid wall (228 ETH) vs. concentrated ask liquidity.  
- **Sentiment**: Rising leverage stress (Galaxy Digital) offsets ETF inflow optimism.  
- **Volume**: Bearish volume spikes on down-moves (e.g., 16.9k ETH at 4353 breakdown).  
- **Structure**: Failed rebound from 4304 support suggests continuation downside.
