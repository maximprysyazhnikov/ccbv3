### RAYUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: NO_TRADE  
**Confidence**: 65%  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Technical**: Price stuck in downtrend (lower highs/lows) with weak bounces, no clear reversal pattern.  
- **Orderbook**: Balanced liquidity, but bid wall at 3.346 (~5% below) suggests downside risk if broken.  
- **News**: Mixed sentiment (leverage stress vs. institutional ETF inflows), no direct RAY catalyst.  
- **Volume**: Declining volume on minor rallies, indicating lack of conviction.  
- **Risk/Reward**: Poor setupâ€”no clear support for LONG, shorts risky near bid wall.  

*Await stronger structure or catalyst.*
