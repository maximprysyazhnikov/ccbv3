### ETHUSDT Trade Brief  
**Direction**: LONG  
**Confidence**: 68%  
**Entry**: 4325.52 (ask)  
**Stop**: 4304.80 (recent swing low)  
**Take**: 4366.01 (recent resistance)  

**Reasoning**:  
- **Orderbook**: Strong buy-side dominance (`BUY_DOMINANT`) with bid wall at 4325.08.  
- **Technical**: Price holding above key support (4304.80) after recent bounce.  
- **News**: Institutional buying spree (Goldman Sachs, Harvard) offsets leverage stress concerns.  
- **Volume**: Recent spike in buy volume near lows suggests accumulation.  
- **Risk**: Leverage stress news could trigger liquidations if price breaks 4304.
